## Max power Problem Code: MAX2

### All submissions for this problem are available.
### Given a binary number (of N bits) X. Find the highest power of 2 that divides this number.

#### Note: If the binary number is "100" then the highest power of 2 that divides it is 2 (as 22 = 4)


## Input:
### The first line contains N the number of bits in the number
### The next line contains a binary number of N bits

## Output:
### The first and only line contains the max power of 2 that divides the given number

## Constraints:
### 1≤N≤105
### 1≤X

## Sample Input:
### 5
### 10100

## Sample Output:
### 2
